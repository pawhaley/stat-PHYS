\begin{exercise}{1.37}
For a adiabatic process with diatomic gas $VT^{5/2}$ is constant.  Note that $V_iT_i^{5/2}=V_fT_f^{5/2}=\frac{V_i}{20}T^{5/2}$ thus $T_f=T_i\cdot 20^{2/5}\approx 975K\approx 1295^\circ F$ since we get auto ignition at $410^\circ F$, we need no spark plug.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}{1.40}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Since we know that $V=\frac{NkT}{P}$ we can write $dV=Nk(\frac{1}{P} dT-\frac{T}{P^2}dP)$.  Note that $dU=-PdV=Nk(-dT+\frac{T}{P}dP)$ and that $dU=\frac{f}{2} NkdT$, thus $\frac{f}{2} NkdT=Nk(-dT+\frac{T}{P}dP)$ or simplified $\frac{dT}{dP}=\frac{2T}{(f+2)P}$.
\item
Note that $\frac{dT}{dz}=\frac{dT}{dP} \frac{dP}{dz}=\frac{2T}{(f+2)P} \frac{-mgP}{kT}=\frac{-2mg}{(f+2)k}$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}{1.41}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Water has a specific heat of 4.186 joule/gram K.  Our waters heat capacity is 1046.5 joule/K.  Thus we gained 4186 joule of heat.
\item
By conservation of energy the metal lost 4186 joule.
\item
Heat capacity is $\frac{Q}{\Delta T}=\frac{-4186}{-76}=55.079\text{joule/K}$.
\item
Specific heat is .55079 joule/gram K.
\end{enumerate}
